excerpt: 'Consider a geometric range space $(X,\c{A})$ where $X$ is comprised of the union of a red set $R$ and blue set $B$.  Let $\Phi(A)$ define the absolute difference between the fraction of red and fraction of blue points which fall in the range $A$.
The maximum discrepancy range $A^* = \arg \max_{A \in (X,\c{A})} \Phi(A)$. 
Our goal is to find some $\hat{A} \in (X,\c{A})$ such that 
$\Phi(A^*) - \Phi(\hat A) \leq \eps$. 
We develop general algorithms for this approximation problem for range spaces with bounded VC-dimension, as well as significant improvements for specific geometric range spaces defined by balls, halfspaces, and axis-aligned rectangles.  This problem has direct applications in discrepancy evaluation and classification, and we also show an improved reduction to a class of problems in spatial scan statistics.'
