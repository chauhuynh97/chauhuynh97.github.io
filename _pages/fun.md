# Family Stuff
Most of my family live around Columbus in Ohio. My dad builds furniture, welds, and works on random projects. My mom teaches an [AP Statistics class](https://www.aphomeschoolers.com/cgi-bin/choose.pl?class=statistics) and quilts for fun. My brother just recently graduated from Ohio State University and is working for Chase bank on fraud detection and does [photography](http://Imagesbymm.com) for fun and profit on the side.
