# Family Stuff
My parents live in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. My dad is an otorhinolaryngologist and likes to plant fruit trees. My mom helps out at my grandma's jewelry shop.

In Seattle, I have my brother and 3 cousins that I often hangout with. My brother works at FedEx. My oldest cousin, Vy, is a chemistry and math teacher for high school students. Her middle sister, Linh is a CS student at Seattle University. Van, the youngest sister, is a freshman at University of Washington studying Architectural Design and Construction Management.
