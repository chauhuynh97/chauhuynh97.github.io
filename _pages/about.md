I am a 5th year PhD student at the [School of Computing](http://www.cs.utah.edu/) in the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/) being advised by [Dr. Jeff Phillips](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~jeffp/). Currently my research focuses on Spatial Scan Statistics and related problems dealing with range spaces. I am also interested more broadly in computational geometry, sublinear time algorithms, and approximations.

As an undergraduate I was at the University of Delaware from 2010 to 2014 and received a Computer Science B.S. and Math minor. There I did research with [Dr. Michela Taufer](https://www.eecs.utk.edu/people/faculty/dr-michela-taufer/) at the [Global Computing Lab](https://globalcomputing.group/about.html) on some problems relating to high performance computing and volunteer computing.

In my spare time I enjoy doing outdoor activities such as rock climbing, hiking, and skiing, and indoor activities such as eating unhealthy food and playing the occasional rpg.
